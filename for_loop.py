'''The for loop is used to iterate over a given sequence, such as lists or strings.'''

# words = ["hello", "world", "spam", "eggs"]
# for word in words:
#   print(word + "!")

# nums=[4, 7, 3, 1]
# for x in nums:
#     print(x*2)

# str="testing for loops"
# i=0
# for x in str:
#   if(x=='t'):
#     i+=1
# print(i)

'''Similar to while loops, the break and continue statements can be used in for loops, 
to stop the loop or jump to the next iteration.'''

# text="some text"
# for x in text:
#   if x=='e':
#     break
#   print(x)

# list=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
# for x in list:
#    if(x%2==1 and x>4):
#       print(x)
#       break

'''The for loop is useful when the number of iterations is fixed. For example, 
iterating over a fixed list of items in a shopping list.

The while loop is useful in cases when the number of iterations isnâ€™t known and 
depends on some calculations and conditions in the code block of the loop. For example, 
ending the loop when the user enters a specific input in a calculator program.'''
